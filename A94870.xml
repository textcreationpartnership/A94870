         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Part of this Work I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to open and refute the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Opinion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Obedience to the Goſpel: Which (however plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly worded, and vented) is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance no other, than the Old <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of Merits and Juſtification by Works: And wherein it is refin'd from the old <hi>School</hi>-Notions, it cometh but ſo much the nearer to <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:150330:5"/>whence the whole Platform of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was taken, and differs from it very little.</p>
            <p>In this preſent Treatiſe my work is to explain and confirm the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine of Juſtification by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed to us by God, and received by us by Faith, which is denied by the Aſſertors of Conditional Justification. They are indeed almost as loath the People ſhould know, that they deny us to be juſtified by the Merits or Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as once <hi>Steph. Gardner</hi> was, That the Doctrine of Juſtification by Free Grace ſhould be preached to them: And for the ſame Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſaving of their own Credit: And hence they tell us, That the Term of Imputation of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſtill to be retained: That Chriſt meriteth our Justification, That he is our Legal or Pro-legal Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They ſpeak as like our Orthodox Divines as they can, that it may not commonly appear wherein they differ: Yet in all this, they mean no more but that Chriſt by his Obedience, or Death, or both, obtained a New Covenant for us, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Evangelical Law,
<pb facs="tcp:150330:5"/>which if we fulfill, and continue in it to the end of our Lives, we ſhall have our Sins pardoned, ſhall be accepted and ſaved. So that the Righteouſneſs for which we ſhall be accepted, and made Heirs of Eternal Life, is our Obedience to the Goſpel, not the Obedience or Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and with them the Imputing of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us for Justification, is our being juſtified by our own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel-Covenant, which Chriſt procured by his Righteouſneſs; not our being juſtified or accepted to life for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and performed immediately and only for us, as all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have hitherto taught, except the <hi>Dutch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> and their Followers. They do endeavour to obſcure and perplex the Queſtion what they can, partly by the Rhetorical, and ſometimes Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Expreſſions of Popular Preachers and Writers, (which ought rather to be interpreted and qualified, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitated to the prejudice of Truth) and partly by the <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Notions and <hi>School</hi>-Terms accommodated to this Doctrine as well as others, and too much
<pb facs="tcp:150330:6"/>transferred from the <hi>Schools</hi> of the Learned to the Pulpit and popular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: From both theſe they pick matters of quarrel against this received and fundamental Truth: And always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Queſtion in ſuch terms, that it may ſeem they diſpute only againſt the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> or ſome that have ſpoke too like them; or elſe ſome <hi>Logical</hi> Notions and Formalities of <hi>School-Divines:</hi> Amongſt all that I have read with ſome care to know the true state of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and what the New Doctrine of thoſe men is, I have not met with one that doth fairly and ingenuouſly ſtate the Queſtion according to the Sence, which they intend, and diſpute for: But they always thruſt in ſome terms lyable to exception, which belong not to the ſubſtance of the Question it ſelf, <hi>e. g.</hi> They uſually propound the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be imputed to us, ſo that we are accounted by God to have done and ſuffered all, that Chriſt did and ſuffered for us, whether we fulfill the Law in him, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:150330:6"/>the Penalty of it in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then they infer from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Imputation in general, what followeth only from their miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, That we ſatisfied for our ſelves, obeyed and ſuffered for our ſelves, were our own <hi>Mediatours</hi> and <hi>Saviours,</hi> &amp;c. Which Conſequences ſeem not only uncooth but abſurd <hi>I</hi> and are readily received by the unlearned and precipitant Wits, who had rather ſeem ingenious in finding fault with old received Doctrines, than take pains to underſtand them throughly.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to divest the Doctrine of Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs Imputed, of the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both of <hi>School</hi>-Notions, and popular <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> and to preſent it in the plain <hi>Scriptural</hi> dreſs, to prove it by plain <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> deduced thence, in the three firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and then to examine their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ections against it, which, when they are levelled againſt the Queſtion as it is plainly ſtated, are ſo inconſiderable, that I cannot but wonder, that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:150330:7"/>and Pious men ſhould lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon them, as to innovate, and alter the Doctrine which all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants have profeſt, writ, and died for; this is done in the fourth Chapter, In the fifth and ſixth I examine the original and true meaning of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Opinion and refute it. In the reſt of the Book I explain and defend the <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Office of <hi>Faith</hi> in justifying us, and anſwer the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion betwixt us is plainly this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether God doth juſtifie Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinners, <hi>i. e.</hi> acquit them from Guilt and Puniſhment, and give them a Right to Eternal Life for their own Obedience to the Goſpel? Or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt wrought for them, and truſted in by them, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Promiſes of the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former they affirm, and we have diſproved in the other Part: The

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Nature of Juſtification explained, and that it is not a meer forgiving of Sin.</head>
               <p>THE Doctrine of Juſtification by Free Grace and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, hath been ſo abundantly defended by our Proteſtant Writers of every Nation and every Univerſity, profeſſing the Reformed Religion, that I need ſay little to confirm it; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing I have met with nothing in our late Authors objected againſt it, but what hath been frequently objected againſt it by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> before, and as frequently anſwered by our Writers: The chief Work is to diſcover
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150330:11"/>the Artifice wherewith the New Doctrine of Conditional Juſtification is covered and made plauſible; whereas it is indeed the Old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Arminian Doctrine of Juſtification by Works, as I hope I have in ſome meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the former Part. Yet that this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe may be compleat, and that we may not ſeem only <hi>diſtruere aliena,</hi> and not at all <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruere propria,</hi> I ſhall endeavour briefly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the received Doctrine of Juſtification and imputed Righteouſneſs. And firſt of the Nature of Juſtification. Our fore cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and their Friends generally affirm, That the Juſtification of a Sinner before God is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a full Pardon of all Sins, both of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, whereby all guilt and obligation to puniſhment being removed, Man is reſtored <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to his former State, and to all thoſe Priviledges which by Sin he forfeited. This they maintain that they may the more effectually overthrow the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, ſuppoſing that if the bare Remiſſion of Sin doth both acquit from Puniſhment and reſtore a Right to Life or Bleſſedneſs, then there needeth no poſitive Righteouſneſs to be imputed to intitle to life and to make us acceptable with God. This is the main drift of Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> his Book about Imputation of Righteouſneſs;<note place="margin">Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi. <hi>p. 110.</hi> &amp;c.</note> and is largely proſecuted by Mr. <hi>Trueman,</hi> not without many confident miſtakes. But this Opinion overthroweth their own Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon condition of our Obedience, as well as ours of the Imputation of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150330:11"/>and more; which I thus prove.</p>
               <p>Meer Pardon of Sin is nothing elſe but a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the Proceſs of the Law, that a Man ſhould not ſuffer the Penalties of it, but enjoy quietly his former freedom and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges notwithſtanding his Offences. Now this Diſcharge requireth no Righteouſneſs at all, our own no more than Chriſts, This Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don makes a Man righteous in the Law (they ſay) <hi>i. e.</hi> The Law hath no more to do with him or to ſay againſt him; he is as free from all condemnation as if he were innocent, and had fulfilled the Law. Hence it follows that a Man is juſtified without the intervening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his own Obedience: If any poſitive righteouſneſs be neceſſary to pardon, it is not meer pardon: And why may not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed be joyned with and be the Cauſe of Pardon, as well as our own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience? To ſay a Man is juſtified upon the condition of Goſpel Obedience (which is our Inherent Righteouſneſs) and that he is juſtified by the bare Remiſſion of Sins, is a Contradiction. Moreover, theſe Authors do acknowledge that Chriſt merited the Pardon of Sin, ſo that a Sinner is juſtified or pardoned and ſo reſtored to favour for the ſake of Chriſts Satisfaction. Doth it not then follow that the Death of Chriſt is the Cauſe of Pardon; then it is not meer pardon, but pardon procured or merited: and if Chriſts Death be the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of pardon to every Believer, then it is imputed or applyed to every pardoned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For no cauſe can produce its effects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150330:12"/>Application to the Subject, in whom the effect is wrought; and the Application of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe to the Subject for whom it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth, is Imputation, or accounting that what was done by that Cauſe was done for that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And thus we ſee this Doctrine maketh more againſt themſelves than againſt us. But that Juſtification includeth more than Pardon of Sin, even a poſitive Righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Man is accepted to Life Eternal, I ſhall thus evince.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Notation of the Words. To Pardon is only to releaſe from the Penalty of the Law; but to Juſtifie is to Acquit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to diſcharge from guilt and accuſation, Rom. 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is God that Juſtifieth.</hi> It is confeſſed that to juſtifie an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to acquit; but to juſtifie a Sinner, they ſay is only to forgive him: But in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage doth the word ſo ſignifie? When the King pardoneth an Offender, doth any man ſay, doth the Law ever ſay the King juſtifies him? A Brother is commanded to forgive his Brother from the Heart; and ſo <hi>Job</hi> did no doubt forgive his Friends, and yet he ſaith, <hi>God forbid I ſhould Juſtifie you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. <hi>27.</hi> v. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Is any Man ſaid to juſtfie him whom he pardoneth? Why ſhould the Scripture beſides the familiar words of Pardoning and Forgiving uſe another term, <hi>viz.</hi> to Juſtifie? which in its Etymology and common uſe ſignifieth to declare Righteous, and yet mean no more by Juſtification than
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150330:12"/>bare Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, A full Pardon makes a Man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, foraſmuch as he that is diſcharged from all Sin, is accounted not to have broke the Law; and not to have broke it, is all one as to have fulfill'd it: But this is a miſtake; He that forgives an Offender does not therefore account or make him Righteous, though he will not exact the Penalty of him. Pardon doth ſuppoſe a Man to have been a Sinner, and ſo it leaves him as one that hath deſerv'd puniſhment, though by favour he is exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it; the Law ſtill chargeth him with ſin and ſentenceth him to puniſhment, though the Judge ſuperſedeth his Sentence and will not execute the Law.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Great Prop. <hi>p. 121.</hi>
                  </note> Pardon is <hi>diſſolutio obligationis ad poenam,</hi> diſſolveth the Obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment; and when there is no obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, a man is innocent and hath right to impunity.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer: The Antecedent is untrue; The Obligation to puniſhment ariſeth from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal Nature of the Law, which (being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) exacteth puniſhment as a due Debt. <hi>The Wages of Sin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. So that if pardon take away the obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it maketh ſin to be no ſin: But ſin is ſin though forgiven, and the Sinner deſerves to die although he ſhall not die. Pardon taketh away the Ordination or Deſtination of a Man to Puniſhment that he is not appointed to die, but not the Obligation that he doth not deſerve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150330:13"/>to die. I conclude Pardon doth not render a Man as innocent, as no Tranſgreſſor, and therefore 'tis not all one with juſtifying or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring righteous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From thoſe Phraſes whereby Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is expreſſed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. It is paraphraſed thus: <hi>As he hath choſen us in him that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love.</hi> He who is only forgiven his Sins, is not accounted as holy and blameleſs: Pardon ſuppoſeth guilt and that which ſome call <hi>reatum culpae,</hi> the guilt of the fault remaineth after pardon, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a Man hath broken the Law, and by ſuch habits or actions he hath been diſobedient to the Commands. Pardon only takes away <hi>reatum penoe,</hi> the appointment of a Man to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, therefore there muſt be ſomething more to render men <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, holy and blameleſs before God, and Objects of his Love. <hi>Rom</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. Juſtification is called <hi>Imputing of Righteouſneſs;</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6. Juſtification by Works and by Faith are oppoſed by the Names of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> To juſtifie therefore is to reckon or to declare in judgment, that a Man is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and as if Man had been juſtified by the Law of Works he had then been pronounced righteous: So now he is to be juſtified by Faith, he is to be declared righteous by the Righteouſneſs of Faith, though not of Works. Therefore Juſtification is more than Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note>Both parts of the diſjunction are untrue: the firſt, that he that is pardoned is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ſtill: for if by favour puniſhment be remitted, and no ſatisfaction be made to the Law, then the Law remains broken ſtill, and he is a Sinner ſtill though forgiven. For it is not the Law that pardoneth (if that might take effect it would condemn) but the Law-Giver by his own Prerogative; which pardon is not therefore looked upon as the fulfilling or the Righteouſneſs of the Law. But if (as in our caſe) the Law was ſatisfied, and by reaſon of that ſatisfaction man is pardoned (as this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Author acknowledgeth a little before)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150330:14"/>then that ſatisfaction of the Law repaireth the Breach of it, and ſo there is the real righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, firſt imputed to a Man, and then by reaſon thereof he is pardoned, <hi>i.e.</hi> acquitted from puniſhment to which he was obnoxious before: And thus here is a fair Contradiction that a Man is juſtified by a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſatisfactory to the Law yet barely pardoned. The ſecond part of the Diſjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That there is no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt being righteous and unrighteous is alſo untrue; we ſpeak of a declarative Righteouſneſs. Now it is apparent that there is a Middle betwixt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified and being condemned, <hi>viz. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium negationis,</hi> or rather <hi>privationis. Adam</hi> before he fell was not condemned, having not yet ſinned; nor was he juſtified, having not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that courſe of obedience to which life was promiſed: It is true he was righteous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently, and alſo in the eye of the Law, ſo far as he had obeyed, and ſo far might be ſaid to be juſtified, <hi>viz.</hi> Inchoatively. But in this Queſtion we take juſtification for that perfect Act whereby a Sinner is fully acquitted and accepted to life eternal, and thus <hi>Adam</hi> was not juſtified, and therefore in a middle ſtate: So then, Pardon doth not make a Man righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or juſtified, but in the preciſe Notion of it, it is a Middle betwixt condemnation and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Non-condemnation, but if you add that a Man is forgiven for Chriſt's ſake, then you add ſomething beſides Meer Pardon and ſo deſert the Queſtion.</p>

               <p>Beſides, this Argument makes ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, for the Condition from which man fell was but a State of Probation, wherein he had no immutable right to life; therefore Pardon reſtoring him but to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Condition, putteth him again but into a State of Probation, and giveth no certain right to life. Nay by this Doctrine Sin is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in this Life: A Man is not acquitted or put out of danger of puniſhment, ſeeing his Salvation dependeth upon conditions which muſt be in fulfilling till his lives end: So that Pardon with them is no more, than a Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150330:15"/>of puniſhment, together with a promiſe of life and impunity if man fulfill the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel.

               <p n="4">4. The next Effect of Juſtification is a new Heart or Grace to fit and bring man to life which Juſtification entitleth to. The Spirit of Sons and the Glory of Heav'n are the Fruits of Adoption; but Life and Happineſs ſimply, and the Spirit of Sanctification are the Effects of Juſtification, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12, 13. The new Heart is promiſed as an Effect of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin. Hence I argue, That which gives with the right to life all the means neceſſary to attain life is more than pardon of ſin: But Juſtification by Chriſt gives a right to all the Means neceſſary to attain eternal life, as well as to life it ſelf: <hi>Ergò,</hi> The Reaſon of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor is, pardon in the common notion of it, and with our Oppoſites, doth only put a man into that ſtate or favour he was in before, but in that condition there was no certainty of grace to perſevere and to come to life. When we pardon an Offendor we receive him into our former favour, and lay aſide all thoughts of enmity, but we do not count our ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by all means poſſible to endeavour to prevent his offending for the future; that care reſteth on him; therefore if Juſtification give a right to the Grace of God which ſhall be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to bring us to life, it is more than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150330:16"/>or putting us into our former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein we had no ſuch promiſe.

                  </gap> Grace is the Effect of Sin, therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of Grace is the Effect of full Pardon and Juſtification. The Scriptures teach that all ſulneſs of Grace was given to Chriſt, that we might receive of his Fulneſs Grace for

And wherefore is the Power of giving Grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Mediatour, if not purchaſed by him, and why doth he interceede for that he never bought and paid for? If then Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Grace as well as a Right to Life, then Juſtification giveth a Right to Grace as well as to Life it ſelf, and ſo is more than Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

I argue from the Impulſive Cauſes; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is an Act of meer Mercy, but Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Act of Juſtice; therefore it is not meer Pardon.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150330:19"/>the Law be broken it doth accidentally require both obedience and ſuffering of puniſhment; the latter for the recompence of injured Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that the Law may not be deſpiſed or broken <hi>impunè,</hi> and the former as that which is the proper and natural end of the Law. When a man ſuffereth the penalty of any Law, the Law is ſo far ſatisfied that it can exact no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment, but doth he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the rewards of the Law, as if he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed it? He is indeed reſtored to his former State, <hi>i. e.</hi> puniſhment ceaſeth and he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the priviledge of other men to live in obedience to the Law for the future, but he hath not the reward of obedience, nor is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for his ſuffering to be upon the ſame terms with the obedient: In like manner, our Lord Chriſt by ſuffering the penalties of the Law did recompence the injured Honour and Juſtice of God, and of the Law, ſo that it could require no more puniſhment of him or of thoſe that believe in him; but he did not therefore deſerve the rewards of the Law, they were procured by his obedience to it. It is not true of the Law of God, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth either to be obeyed, or that the penalty ſhould be endured; for ſo men ſhould obey and fulfill the Law in a ſort by going to hell for breaking it. The Law promiſed life only to obedience, not to the ſuffering of death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt by ſuffering of death did fulfill what the Law required, but accidentally and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily by reaſon of ſin, but by obeying the Law he fulfilled the primary and immediate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150330:20"/>end of the Law, and ſo merited the promiſed reward. There muſt therefore be a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of conformity to the Law, whereby muſt be procured a right to life, as well as a ſuffering of the penalty, whereby a ſtop is put to further puniſhment, which is all that meer pardon of ſin amounteth to. Upon theſe grounds I take leave to deſcribe Juſtification an Act whereby God doth acquit and accept a Sinner as righteous unto life eternal for the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the precept and ſuffered the penalty of the Law. Juſtification actively taken is Gods Act acquitting or declaring a man righteous; paſſively taken it is a mans ſtate or relation to that Act of God, being declared and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as righteous, of which as it ſuppoſeth a change from a former ſtate of guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; the <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> or ſtate from which he is tranflated is a ſtate of Sin and wrath; the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> is a ſtate of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or being righteous before God; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin or ſtop of puniſhment is included in it, or doth immediately reſult from it; ſo that Juſtification is one ſingle Act and not ſeveral concurring to make it up, though divers things are given or granted by it, either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or conſequentially, as flowing from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect or benefit of it. The main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt this Doctrine is, That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth frequently deſcribe Juſtification by pardon and forgiveneſs, as if they were aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent terms: But the reaſon of this is, Firſt, Becauſe men being ſenſible of ſin and miſery,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150330:20"/>do firſt look after pardon, and therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is promiſed as that which will be moſt welcome and comfortable to them; and alſo becauſe men ſhould be fenſible of their own guilt, and in capacity of making ſatisfaction to God; and therefore that the righteouſneſs by which they muſt be juſtified is not their own but Chriſts, nor contrived or provided by them but by God himſelf for them. What then, Juſtification is called pardon of ſin, <hi>ergò,</hi> it is nothing elſe but Pardon; This is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to Believers explained and proved.</head>
               <p>HAving proved that to Juſtifie is to accept as Juſt or Righteous, and likewiſe that our own Obedience is not, cannot be, the Righteouſneſs wherein we muſt appear before God, it remaineth that it muſt be the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, for and by which we muſt be juſtified, and this is now to be proved. But before we come to the Proof we ſhall briefly inquire, <hi>What we mean by Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and what by the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which we ſay is imputed to a Sinner for his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that Righteouſneſs which he fulfilled or wrought in conformity to the Law of God, whereby the Law violated by us, was fulfilled, and ſatisfied for us, and in our ſtead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Therefore it is not the Righteouſneſs of his Divine Perſon, which is imputed to us; for that is Infinite, ſuch as men are uncapable of, and 'twas never requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them: Yet the Perfections of his God-head do add the meritorious Dignity to his Satisfaction. Nor is it the connate habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Righteouſneſs of his Man-hood: For this is preſuppos'd to enable to the performance of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150330:22"/>the Law, but not properly required by the Law, yet the Law requireth the preſervation and exerciſe of perfect inherent righteouſneſs. <hi>Adam</hi> was created perfect to make him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving a Law of perfect obedience; therefore that Law ſuppoſed a Holy Nature and only required continuance in that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Nature which he had received. In like manner, it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be born with a perfect, holy Nature, that he might undertake the fulfilling of the Law for us; and the preſerving and exerciſe of that Holineſs once received was a part of his obedience to the Law: but that Holineſs as natural and habitual was antecedent to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Law, and therefore no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber part of it. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs then which is imputed to us, is his Holy Life in obedience to the Law of God, and his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary obediential ſuffering the Penalties of the Law unto death it ſelf, for us and in our ſtead. By the latter he made ſatisfaction for our ſins and breach of the Law, and by the former he fulfill'd the Law in the proper and principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, and thereby purchaſed eternal life, which was promiſed by the Law to them that fulfill it. By obeying the ſubſtance of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as given to Man-kind and ſuffering death, the Penalty thereof, he ſatisfied the Law and wrought Righteouſneſs for men in general; and by obeving the Jewiſh Law, and ſuffering the penalties, and that kind of death threatned, and accurſed particularly by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> this Argument our Authors have deviſed new Notion; That Chriſt fulfilled not the Law as given to Man, knowing that then his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs muſt be imputed to Man, but the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150330:29"/>teach that Chriſt fulfilled only a particular Law given to himſelf, which they call the Law of a Mediator, which conſiſteth ſo much of the Law given to Mankind in general, and of ſo much of the Jewiſh Law as the Father thought fit to appoint him to perform, and alſo of ſome particular precepts peculiar to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, wherein Men were not concern'd; which Law if Chriſt would fulfill, Men ſhould have a New Covenant of Life given them: But they could not be juſtified by his fulfilling this Law, becauſe it contained not all things to which they were obliged; and moreover did contain ſome things peculiar to Chriſt in which Men were not concerned. It muſt therefore be proved, That Chriſt was oblig'd to and did fulfill the Law of perfect Obedience given to Men, and the Jewiſh Law which concerned that Nation. It is ſometimes ſaid by our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, <hi>That Chriſt is our Legal Righteouſneſs, that Righteouſneſs which the Law of Works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us:</hi> If ſo, then he muſt have fulfill'd and ſatisfied that Law; but this hath been touched before: I argue therefore, Chriſt was ſubject to the Law of Mankind, elſe he needed not to have been Man: The only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Chriſt was made Man is, that the ſame Nature that ſinned, might alſo ſatisfie for Sin; it muſt therefore be by fulfilling that Law which concerned Humane Nature. For if any other way of ſatisfaction might be admitted, why might it not be accepted from a Perſon of another Nature that was not Man? If there was no neceſſity that the Law broken by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150330:30"/>Man ſhould be fulfilled, but that it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that ſomething ſhould be done to repair God's Honour ſome other way, though his Law was not properly ſatisfied: Why might it not have been enough if Chriſt as God only without aſſuming any created Nature, would have undertaken to conquer the Devils, to bring all Mankind to Repentance, to accept once of Pardon, and to reſtore them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience again: This would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the Honour of God and of the Law, as much or more than the procuring a New Covenant of Salvation for Sinners, which for any thing Chriſt did merit, might have never took effect in any: Why might not this have ſerved without his taking Mans Nature upon him? Moreover the Angels are obliged by the ſame general Law of Love to God and their Fellow creatures that Men are; though the particular Wages of exerciſing it be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. If then it were enough that Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd ſome Generals of the Law without being obliged to all the Particulars that concerned Men, why might it not have ſufficed him to have taken the Nature of Angels, and not to have come down into this miſerable World, for in that he might have performed the Law of a Mediator. However, <hi>à fortiori</hi> he needed not to have been the Son of <hi>Adam</hi> born of a Woman and in the ſame condition with other men, or to have taken upon him the Form of a Servant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. He might have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately created as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and not have derived his Nature from him, if it were not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150330:30"/>that he muſt be ſubject to the ſame Law which <hi>Adam</hi> had broken. It is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. That <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> If Chriſt could not redeem the Jews without being born a Jew, ſubject to their Law, then neither could he redeem the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in general, without being himſelf the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſubject to the ſame Law that he was. I argue alſo from the Nature of the Law; The End of the Law was Obedience, and for failure that the Penalty of it ſhould be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and this was the abſolute eſtabliſht De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or Sanction of God: It muſt therefore be fulfilled by ſome one, it was not done by Men, therefore it muſt be by Chriſt. To ſay that ſome of it was fulfilled and ſome Honour done to it by the Mediatorial Law is of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for this did not fulfill it or ſatisfie the End of it: The Law as a Law and as a Covenant betwixt God and Man was clearly laid aſide if Chriſt fulfill'd it not, and all Mankind after the Fall were by him brought under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and ſo the Law is made void by Faith, contrary to the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. Our Saviour alſo teſtified of himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. That he came <hi>not to deſtroy, but to fulfill the Law:</hi> This was the End of his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and his fulfilling was his obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, performing the Law as he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. <hi>It becometh us to fulfill all Righteouſneſs:</hi> Therefore he was Baptized, and therefore much more ought he to obſerve the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150330:31"/>Law which was of ancienter Inſtitution. This is confirmed by the Reaſon he giveth for his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>not one Jota or Tittle of the Law ſhould paſs away till all was fulfilled, though Heaven and Earth might paſs away.</hi> The Sanction of the Law is more ſtable than the Ordinances of Heaven and Earth, and muſt attain its End: Therefore every Child of Adam muſt be ſubject to it. Our Saviour adds, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. That he was ſo far from relaxing of the Law, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he affirmed, whoſoever ſhould break the leaſt Commands, and teach others ſo, ſhould be ſhut out of Heaven: Nay that he required a ſtricter Obſervation of it than the Scribes and Phariſees for all their pretended ſeverities in ſome things. Now that all this was meant of the Law as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> chiefly of the Moral Law, is manifeſt by his proceeding to expound and vindicate the Commandments in his following Diſcourſe, <hi>v.</hi> 21. to the end, from the ſlight Comments of their preſent Teachers. In like manner when it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all them that believe,</hi> Rom. 10.4. It is meant of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for it is immediately added, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law, that the Man that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Now Chriſt is the End of the Law, not ſimply by waving it and diſannulling its Obligation; for then the Law ſhould not have its End, nor be unchangeable as he had told us it was: but He is the End of it for righteouſneſs to them that believe by fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150330:31"/>it in his own perſon for them; ſo that, their Righteouſneſs or Juſtification may not depend upon their own Obedience to it. Again Chriſt redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. being made a Curſe for us. How was Chriſt made a Curſe but by bearing the Penalty of the Law for Sin? For the Curſe is not only the Matter of Puniſhment, the evil inflicted, but formal puniſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> Evil inflicted for Sin, for the ſatisfaction of Juſtice and the violated Law. Now how came this Curſe to fall upon Chriſt? Even by the Law it ſelf adjudging him to it. For thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argueth, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>They that are of the Works of the Law, under the power of it, are under the Curſe.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the Curſe of the Law by being made a Curſe for us.</hi> This is the Argument, Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified by the Law, for that curſeth all that are under it; but we ſhall be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>becauſe he bore the Curſe of the Law for us.</hi> He muſt therefore be under the Law as we were. And it is further proved, becauſe it is written, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23.</note> What is this to the Death of Chriſt, if he were not under the Law? And if he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Jewiſh Law which pronounced the Death of the Croſs accurſed in ſpecial manner, then by the ſame reaſon, he was under the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> which pronounced Death in general as a Curſe for Sin. Laſtly, If the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt were not inflicted by virtue of the Law of Works, then they were not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150330:32"/>nor had they any thing of God's wrath in them, for it was that Law only that threatned a Curſe: They were only Prudential, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſomething ſhould be ſuffered which that Law threatned, that ſo it might decently be laid aſide. Now if Chriſt were ſubject to the Law as to the Curſe, he was alſo ſubject to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and ſo his Obedience was in our ſtead, and therefore to be imputed to us for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. We were not obliged to the Law of a Mediator; Chriſt fulfilled not that in our ſtead, if then he did and ſuffered any thing in our ſtead, it was in obedience to our Law, and ſo to be placed to our Account.</p>

It is ſpoken immediately of the Jewiſh Law, but the Reaſon extendeth it to every Law; he that

This is thus proved; It is none of the four kind of Cauſes, nor reducible to them; therefore it is no Cauſe. The Antecedent I thus prove; It is not the Material or Formal Cauſe, this they grant, For then we muſt be immediately juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it, it muſt compoſe our righteouſneſs; they ſometimes call it the matter of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but without ſence: It is not the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe, Chriſts righteouſneſs is not the end for which we are juſtified: It is not the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, neither Phyſical, nor Moral: Not Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, for then Chriſts obedience muſt actively work obedience, or righteouſneſs in us, which is abſurd. Not a Moral Cauſe, or Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (which they moſt inſiſt on.) For Chriſt did not merit Grace, whereby we ſhould obtain the Goſpel, and ſo be juſtified as they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſeeing he died for all alike (though thus he would be but a remote meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification, meriting that for which we ſhould be juſtified) but he merited only the Covenant of Life upon ſincere obedience to the Law he ſhould preſcribe. All then that he is the Meritorious Cauſe of is the New Covenant; for when this Covenant is promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated it is left to men whether they will obey or no, and ſo whether they will be juſtified or no: He hath merited nothing further. Now
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150330:41"/>if any man come to be juſtified by performing the condition of this Covenant, can Chriſt be ſaid to merit this Juſtification for him, which as to his Merits was contingent, might or might not be, and depended wholly upon his own Will and Obedience? If a man procure a Charter for a Town, and make them a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration thereby, and by virtue of this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they that ſerve an Apprentiſhip ſhall have the Privileges and Freedom of this Town, ſhall it be ſaid of thoſe that thus come into the Freedom ſome hundred years after, that their Freedom was merited, bought or procured by him that procured the Charter? Surely they themſelves merit their Freedom, the other was but an Inſtrument of procuring the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In like manner, if Chriſt only merited the Covenant, by performing whereof men ſhall be juſtified, ſurely men themſelves are the proper, meritorious, immediate cauſes of their own Juſtification, or Righteouſneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fulfill the condition whereto it is promiſed, and which is the formal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for which they are juſtified; and Chriſt is but an Inſtrument of procuring the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and an improper remote, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent cauſe of their Juſtification, by their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling it.

Thus our ſins are ſaid to be imputed to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was truly, and in the Fathers, and in his own intentions puniſhed for them.

Many labour to make this Poſition o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious by miſrepreſenting it, and putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to harſh and unſcriptural terms: But the Queſtion is plainly this, Whether the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt were truly and intentionally the Puniſhment of the Sins of Man laid upon him;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150330:45"/>whether Chriſt was properly puniſhed for their Sins? And this the Scripture abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſly affirmeth.</p>

               <p>Chriſt was a common and publick perſon in that he intended his Obedience not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nor for any one perſon, but for the whole Company of the Elect: Chriſt and they are one in Law, in that the benefit of his ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, was intended for them, and in time conferred on them: But he was not a common perſon, or one in Law with them ſo as they might be properly reckoned to have done what he did; for this holdeth only where the common perſon is a Delegate or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner of others, when they appoint him their

                  <p>The one is, If we be juſtified by the very perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, then he muſt have performed all the Duties that belong to every particular Believer, the Ceremonial and the Moral to the married and to the unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, to Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this he neither did nor could do: <hi>Ergò.</hi>

If it was ſufficient for this, why is it not ſufficient to juſtifie us by immediate Imputation: They will not ſay that our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel doth fill up the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt wherein it was ſhort or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſective, why might it not then juſtifie us ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely by the meer application of it to us as well as purchaſe that we ſhould be juſtified by New Obedience? This is further manifeſt by this, That the Subſtance and End of the Law,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150330:52"/>
                     <hi>ſc.</hi> univerſal Love and Subjection to God in whatſoever he doth or ſhall command is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Duty of all men, and every one muſt habitually keep the whole Law: This was chiefly intended by God, and to be attended by Men; the particular Duties are various, and ſomething are the Duties of one which are not of another; and in many caſes things are and have been Duties at one time which have not been at another. It was therefore ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that Jeſus Chriſt had the habit of all Grace and the readineſs to obey his Father in any thing that he ſhould require, as well as in thoſe things which he did actually perform, and that he did obey actually in as many things as the Father thought fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to impoſe on him, which were not a few: The Law had its end by him, even perſonal Obedience, and thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein he obſerved it were more honour to God than if we had all obſerved our particular Duties, becauſe of the Dignity of his perſon, and the ſupereminent meaſure of Grace and the Spirit from which he did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. This is evident <hi>à pari: Adam</hi> brought condemnation upon all men, not by breaking every particular Command, which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern every particular man, but by one act of Diſobedience, by breaking our Command, whereby his univerſal Obedience was tryed; Why might not then the Sovereign Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker impoſe upon Chriſt ſo much particular Duty for ſo many years as the Exerciſe of the Univerſal Habit of Obedience that was in him, and accept it as if he had fulfilled every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150330:53"/>of the Law? If he that offendeth in one Command is a Tranſgreſſor of the whole Law, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. Why may not he that keepeth it in all particulars required of him, and that was able and ready to keep it in any other, had they been impoſed, be accounted to have kept the whole Law? If they ſay, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> virtually broke the whole Law, I ſay that Chriſt virtually and habitually kept the whole Law; Therefore this was ſufficient that we might be juſtified by his Righteouſneſs. The ſame is to be ſaid concerning the Sufferings of Chriſt; he did not ſuffer all the particular Puniſhments due to every particular Sin of all Believers, nor ſome of the circumſtances of any puniſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternity and Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he ſuffered the Wrath and Curſe of God which was the ſubſtance of the Threatnings, and in ſuch an eminent manner as no meer Creature could have ſuffered, and with a Mind habitually ready and able to have endured any other particular Puniſhments if the Father had thought fit to enjoyn them: It was death in the general, the Curſe of God, which was the Subſtance of the Threatning; God diſpenſeth the particularities of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he pleaſeth, baring more and longer with ſome than others, giving more and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mercies to ſome than others, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt ſome, even of the Wicked from Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death, even thoſe that ſhall be found alive at Chriſt's Coming: The particularities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Puniſhments are not Eſſential to the Law, and Chriſt did bear the Subſtance of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150330:53"/>Curſe with all the Particulars of it, which God thought ſit to inflict, being ready to have born more if it had ſo pleaſed the Father. Why is not this ſufficient to juſtifie us by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, in concomitance with his active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as well as to procure our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon fulfilling Goſpel-Obedience, which they contend for? By this alſo we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that Argument which all our Opponents uſe as unanſwerable, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt paid not the <hi>idem</hi> but the <hi>tantundem,</hi> not the very Obedience and Suffering due from every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Believer, but ſomething in liew of it, and therefore it cannot be imputed to them for Righteouſneſs: For Chriſt did both, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the <hi>idem</hi> in the Subſtance, obeying the ſame Law which obliged them in his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience, and ſuffering the Subſtance of the Curſe, and alſo in as many particulars of obedience and ſuffering as the Father thought fit to exact of him, and this which was ſo far <hi>idem,</hi> the ſame, being performed by ſuch a Perſon, was <hi>tantundem,</hi> equivalent to all the reſt which were not actually done or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him: Yea he did habitually in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of his Mind, and virtually in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his Actions and Paſſions do and ſuffer all the reſt.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150330:55"/>according to the extent of the thing, or the virtue of the efficient. The Sun which is ſeen by half the World at once; the ſound which is heard by many thouſands, are ſeen and heard by each one in particular for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but not accordieg to that univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whereby they are ſeen and heard by all the reſt. But to come nearer the caſe, Gods act of Creation and conſervation is infinite, and yet every creature created and preſerved thereby is finite: Gods courſe to the actions of the creatures is infinite as proceeding from him, yet it maketh not the actions of the Creatures infinite; yea, all the acts of creation, preſervation &amp; concourſe are of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> of the ſame ſort as they proceed from God; it is not one kind whereby Men and Angels are created, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and aſſiſted, and another whereby the ſame things are done for lower creatures, but the ſame infinite power of God applied to each one according to their neceſſities, yet this Identity of the Divine Acts doth not make the Creatures to be of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to exiſt in the ſame manner, or all to operate with one kind of Action. In like manner the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as wrought by him, and proceeding from him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for all the Elect, is infinite and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but as applied to every ſingle perſon, it procureth ſo much pardon as they have need of, and ſatisfyeth ſo much of the Law as they are obliged to, and ſo purchaſeth Eternal Life for every one according to their neceſſity and ſtation. Of the ſame nature is that common
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150330:55"/>Objection, <hi>viz. If we be juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs then are we as righteous as Chriſt;</hi> which followeth not, unleſs his Righteouſneſs was applied to every particular Believer in the ſame manner as it agreeth to Chriſt, which is untrue. Chriſt is righteous inherently, as the immediate, proper Subject of his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and actively as the Author of that Obedience, as he that in his own perſon ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law: A Believer is not at all accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Author of that Righteouſneſs, is not lookt upon as the perſon that obeyed, nor is he the ſubject of inheſion, in whom that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs doth inhere properly and phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he is a legal, ſecondary ſubject, who receiveth the immediate benefit of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as being intended for his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Again, Chriſt wrought his Righteouſneſs for all the Elect in the Office and Perſon of a Mediator, and ſo was not only righteous as a ſingle perſon, but alſo as a publick perſon; but each believer is righteous as a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by that publick and univerſal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt applied to his particular caſe and neceſſity. If a Debtor be diſcharged by his Sureties paying the Debt, may he be ſaid to be as good, as ſolvent a man as his Surety, becauſe the Sureties Payment is imputed to him. If an Innocent perſon be accepted to die for one that deſerves it, may the Guilty perſon be ſaid to be as innocent, or to have ſatisfied for his Crime, as much as the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that died for it: The Payment and the Puniſhment are accepted for the Debtor and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150330:56"/>the Guilty; ſo that they are freed by them, but the honour of being ſolvent and innocent, of paying and ſuffering,<note place="margin">p. 61.</note> for a Friend, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not to them but to the Sponſor.</p>

For we do not maintain, that Believers are accounted to have wrought what Chriſt did, but only that it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have been wrought for them; and yet it is not true, that upon ſuppoſition that they are accounted to have wrought in Chriſt, that it is all one as if they had wrought it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

This doth not corrupt his Perſon or make him morally a Sinner. If a Surety pay a Debt for another it maketh him not guilty of the imprudence, diſhoneſty, or ill-husbandry whereby the debt was contracted; but he having undertaken to ſatisfie for the Debt, the Law requireth pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him as if he were the Debtor, and ſo imputeth the Debt to him: If an innocent perſon be accepted by the Law-giver to die for an Offender, it maketh not him an Offender, though he be puniſhed in the Offenders room and the offence as to the Puniſhment be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him: Yet we may ſay, That legally Chriſt was made a Sinner and his Perſon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, in that he having undertaken to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Law for Sin who had not broken it in his own perſon, nor was obliged to ſuch ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before, doth now become a Debtor to the Law, to ſuffer the Penalty of it, having

We grant there is an over rigid ſence of theſe words, <hi>We are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſt's fulfilling the Law, as if we had fulfilled it in him:</hi> Yet this proveth not, That we are not juſtified immediately by Chriſt's fulfilling the Law, as intended and wrought for us. <hi>Pag.</hi> 24, 25. the Author gives us his own ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, habitual, active, paſſive, and divine, as advancing them in value, is the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification. But are we accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and juſtified immediately for this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? No: Yet that is the Imputation all former Divines maintained. How then? Why, for this Righteouſneſs God maketh a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150330:69"/>Covenant of Grace, in which he freely giveth Chriſt, Pardon, and Life to all that accept the Gift as it is; ſo that the Accepters are by his Covenant or Gift as ſurely juſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as if they obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſatisfied themſelves, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> That the conditions of the Gift in the Covenant of Grace being performed by every penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that Covenant doth pardon all their ſins (as God's Inſtrument) and giveth them a right to eternal life for Chriſt's Merit. This is a confeſſion of what we repreſented before, <hi>ſc.</hi> That the fulfilling the Goſpel-conditions of faith, repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the righteouſneſs which gives us the immediate right to pardon and life, and that Chriſt's righteouſneſs only merited this grant of life upon thoſe conditions. It might be expected by this Hiſtory of the controverſie that ſome Divine ſhould have been quoted which taught this Doctrine, but alas here is not one ſince the Reformation! Therefore I ſhall quote the true Authors of this Opinion after I have vindicated B. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> who are here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ingeniouſly repreſented as laying the ground of this Opinion, and as maintaining Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in another ſence than all had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>For the moſt Learned and Pious Biſhop, It is ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 18, 19. That though he moſt ſtifly defended Imputation in words, yet when he telleth what Proteſtants mean by it, he ſaith, That our own Actions, and Paſſions, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities may not only be imputed to us, but alſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150330:70"/>ſome extrinſecal thing neither inherent in us, nor done by us; <hi>de facto autem imputantur, quando illorum intuitus &amp; reſpectus valent nobis ad aliquem effectum, aequè ac ſi a nobis aut in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis eſſent,</hi> i.e. They are imputed, when the ſight or reſpect of them doth profit us for any effect, as much as if they were in us or done by us: [Note that he ſaith but <hi>ad aliquem ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum non ad omnem,</hi> i.e. to ſome, not to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect.]</p>

I ſee I need not deſpair, but my Books hereafter may be quoted for metaphorical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150330:70"/>caſe. His <hi>37th</hi> Determination is, That Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith is <hi>fiducia,</hi> affiance in God for the remiſſion of ſins through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, that this is the very formal Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith.

Can any thing be more
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150330:72"/>contrary to the Doctrine we oppoſe, that the Goſpel is a Covenant of ſincere Obedience, and that Obedience is the condition of the new Covenant whereby we muſt be juſtified? In all this here is not a word favouring this new Opinion: <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. There is ſomething which may bare a colour of ſome approbation of this Doctrine, but it is but a colour. He ſaith, that Works are in ſome ſort neceſſary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Salvation; but that the term <hi>neceſſary</hi> ought not to be uſed in Diſputes with Papiſts, or in Diſcourſes to the People, leſt they aſcribe too much to them. <hi>Concl.</hi> 2, 3.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150330:72"/>Juſtification: This we all acknowledge that ordinarily in perſons that can uſe their reaſon there are ſuch miniſterial preparations both for converſion and juſtification, and yet they are the cauſes of neither: Nor doth this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that God may extraordinarily ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times work Grace, infuſe Faith, and juſtifie men without ſuch previous diſpoſitions: The reaſon following ſhews this was the Biſhop's ſence.

               <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. ſaith, That Chriſt was delivered, <hi>i. e.</hi> to death, for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Whence our Proteſtants have taught that the proper and immediate Effect of the Death of Chriſt was the procuring or grant of Pardon, Juſtification, Life Eternal, to all the Elect, in the Purpoſes of God, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly God in due time publiſheth to them the Promiſes of the Goſpel, by which through the effectual operation of the Holy Ghoſt they are perſwaded and drawn to Chriſt to believe and truſt in him for Life, and ſo they are made actual partakers of his Death, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. But theſe Authors denying us to be juſtified immediately and properly by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, muſt and do deny Juſtification to be the immediate and proper Effect of it, and aſſign ſome other immediate End of Chriſt's Death. What this is we ſhall ſhew, and how it doth make void the Merit and Satisfaction of Chriſt. I meet with two Opinions in this matter: The Firſt, ſaith, That the immediate and proper End of the Death of Chriſt was not to procure Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all or any man, but to render God placable or reconcileable
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150330:78"/>to man, <hi>i. e.</hi> not that God upon the Death of Chriſt doth grant, purpoſe, or covenant the Juſtification and ſalvation of any man, but that he may now juſtifie, forgive, and ſave men in what way and upon what terms he pleaſeth. Thus Mr. <hi>Trueman</hi> as before:<note place="margin">Gr. Prop. <hi>p. 86.</hi>
                  </note> The immediate Effect of Chriſt's Satisfaction is, that God might be Juſt, though he ſhould pardon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he might pardon <hi>ſalvâ juſtitiâ,</hi> not that he muſt pardon them, come what will of it, or be unjuſt— And again; The Juſtice of God as a flaming Sword obſtructeth all treating with us upon any terms of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever, and this would have been an eternal Bar to all Influences and Effluxes of Favour; and now this Juſtice being ſatisfied, and this Bar and Obſtacle removed, Divine Grace and Benignity is left at liberty freely to act how it pleaſes, and in what way and upon what terms and conditions it thinketh meet. This he had from <hi>Arminius,</hi> who having ſaid, That Juſtification, Pardon, or Reconciliation of any man, is not immediately purchaſed by the Death of Chriſt: He tells us, The proper Effect of it is, <hi>Reconciliatio Dei, remiſſionis, juſtificationis &amp; redemptionis apud Peum impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratio,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That the Obedience of Chriſt was not meritorious, nor did merit any thing of the father: It is true there was an intrinſecal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150330:79"/>value in Chriſt's Obedience, by reaſon of the Divine Excellency of his Perſon, and ſo there was an equality or proportion betwixt his Obedience and the Happineſs which was to be procured for men: But this is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Merit, not Actual Merit. To me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is to deſerve a Reward, to do ſomething whereupon a Reward is due; ſo that Merit in its proper notion doth imply an actual Right or Obligation to a reward, which Obligation ariſeth from ſome Law, Promiſe, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact betwixt the Parties; and he which doth not give that Reward according to Merit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth againſt ſome Law, either of ſtrict Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or at leaſt of Gratitude, Generoſity, Kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If then God was not bound by Covenant, Promiſe, or ſo much as delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Purpoſe to ſave men, or to give them any terms of Life for all that Chriſt did or ſuffered, then his Obedience merited nothing, there was nothing due, no reward propoſed to him, which he would challenge; for God was ſtill free to do what he pleaſed with men: God (they ſay) would not have been unjuſt, if he had not ſaved men (though Chriſt died) he was not then bound by the Law of Juſtice (and he could not be bound by any other Law) to remunerate the Death and Sufferings of his Son with ſuch an happy Effect, as man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Chriſt's Death (ſay they) was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeable payment for ſin, even when it was preſented to the Father; God might then have refuſed it, and yet have been Juſt: But it would not have been juſt to have denyed Jeſus
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:150330:79"/>Chriſt that which he merited, that would be due debt to him. They ſay indeed Chriſt was the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification? But what did he merit? <hi>Juſtification:</hi> Then God was not free to deny it; he muſt juſtifie thoſe for whom Chriſt merited Juſtification, or be unjuſt, unleſs there can be a cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an effect or cauſality: The effect of merit is ſome reward deſerved, given for the ſake of the merit; the cauſality of merit is ſome compact Law or Promiſe, whereby one is bound to reward that merit: If then God was bound to nothing upon the Obedience of Chriſt, but ſtill had <hi>jus integrum,</hi> intire free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to do what he pleaſed, then Chriſt did as freely offer his Obedience to the Father to do what he pleaſed with it, or upon it; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is not to merit. Thus <hi>Slatius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar. apert.

               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6ly.</hi> Nor can it properly be aſcribed to God's Love to the World, that he gave his Son to die, or to the Son's Love to Mankind, that he gave himſelf. For if love to men were the Motive of Chriſt s Obedience and Death, both to the Father and the Son, men's Salvation would have been immediately deſigned and intended in it; it would have been <hi>medium or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatum,</hi> a proper means, deſign'd to bring about their Salvation. But they tell us it was deſigned only to ſave God's Honour, in caſe he ſhould forgive Sinners, but not that he had obliged himſelf any way to do it, no, nor that he had reſolved with himſelf or deliberately
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:150330:82"/>purpoſed to grant terms of Salvation when he ſent his Son into the World, or when he laid his wrath a curſe upon him; it ſeems God did not yet know what uſe he would make of the Death of his Son, neither could the Son know, when the Father was not reſolved. Thus we ſee this Opinion overthroweth the whole Nature and Intendment of Redemption; and Chriſt's Merit, Satisfaction, Ranſom, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and all that belong to it are but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Metaphors, and the greateſt Myſtery of Godlineſs muſt fly for refuge to a poor Trope to ſave it from being an untruth; and Chriſt himſelf muſt be at moſt, but an honorary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>The Second Opinion concerning the End of Chriſt's death is, That he died to purchaſe the Covenant of Grace, or Conditions and Terms of Salvation, by the fulfilling whereof men might be ſaved. Thus the <hi>Arminians</hi> uſed to ſpeak, That Chriſt died <hi>viam ſalutis pandere,</hi> to open a way for Mens Salvation, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe conditions whereupon they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whereas before their Salvation was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, by reaſon of the Curſe or Sentence of the Law of Works. <hi>Act.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150330:83"/>and life to be given by his New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; not that he purchaſed theſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, to be certainly given to any perſons, but that he purchaſed a Covenant or Law of Grace, whereby theſe are promiſed upon condition of Faith and Obedience. And this muſt be the ſence (if any) of thoſe that aſſert Chriſt dying for all men to make them <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi> ſalvable; and to render their Salvation poſſible, being impoſſible before, while the Law of Works ſtood in ſuch ſorce. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt's death, Mens Salvation was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, no new power was acquired to him; and poſſible in its ſelf, Men being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects naturally capable of Salvation; this poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility then, muſt be a poſſibility in Law, as we ſay, <hi>id poſſumus, quod jure poſſumus,</hi> that Chriſt purchaſed a Law and grant of Salvation upon certain Terms, whereby it now became poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all Men to be ſaved if they ſhould have ſufficient notice of it. This Opinion is a little more plauſible, but no more true than the former; which I thus prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot be conceived how Chriſt did purchaſe this Covenant, according to the reſt of their Notions. The occaſion or ground of this Purchaſe was, That God was bound by his own Law of Works violated by Men, to condemn them without Mercy: Now then, could this Obligation be diſſolved without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to, and fulfilling that Law, which yet they will not allow Chriſt to have done, unleſs <hi>per accidens,</hi> as part of it is compriſed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150330:83"/>in that ſpecial Law of Mediator, which was given to him: If it was the Law which hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God from ſhewing mercy, and made mans Salvation impoſſible, then that Law doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige God to ſee it fulfilled, or elſe to grant no life to Sinners; and if Chriſt did not fulfil it, nor was made properly ſubject to it, (as they teach) then he could not properly purchaſe a Covenant of life; if he did fulfil it for ſinners, then they muſt be diſcharged by his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without further conditions impoſed on them, (as hath been often ſaid.) They ſay the Law of Works was neither aboliſhed nor fulfille by Chriſt, but relaxed; I ſuppoſe they mean, That God did not inſiſt upon the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute performance of the Law, but was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to admit of an aequivalent reparation of his Honour, by the Obedience of Chriſt to that Law which he ſhould impoſe on him, wherein ſhould be comprehended a great part of the Moral Law. I reply, If God did relax the Law, ſo as not to require the proper fulfilling of it; then he did loſe the obligation which was laid upon him to ſee it fulfilled: The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate or relative Juſtice of God obliged him to proceed according to that Law; and if he admitted of another way of reparation to his Honour, he did not proceed in a way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in all that he laid upon Jeſus Chriſt; and he might as well have ſaved Man without the Obedience of Chriſt as with it; his Juſtice or Law allowing that relaxation no more than a total ſuperſeding or laying aſide the Law: by this purchaſe therefore they can mean no
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150330:84"/>more, but that Jeſus Chriſt did ſo honour the Father by his Obedience and Sufferings, that he might with <hi>Decorum</hi> to his Majeſty give to Sinners terms of Salvation, and would do it: but this is no purchaſe, which transferreth a legal right to the Purchaſer, if the Purchaſe be accepted; but dependeth meerly upon Promiſe or Terms of Honour. It is alſo great preſumption for Men to judge what is becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Divine Majeſty, and what will ſalve his Honour, other then what is according to his Law or Promiſe: wherers here they make him to wave his own declared Law founded in the higheſt reaſon and equity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Nor in this ſence is the death of Chriſt a ranſome, ſatisfaction or propitiation. A ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reſpecteth perſons to be redeemed; it is a price given for them, not for Laws and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants: Whoever paid a ranſome without agreeing to whom it ſhould extend, and that it ſhould take certain effect? whereas here is nothing purchaſed but a Covenant or Promiſe, that all thoſe that believe and obey the Goſpel ſhould be ſaved, which perhaps might be none nor was it agreed how long the World ſhould ſtand, and ſo what number of Men ſhould be made, or ſhould need, or be capable of this Redemption. A ſatisfaction to God in this caſe, is a ſatisfaction to his Law, whereby the Sinner muſt immediately be diſcharged. A Propitiation is a Sacrifice appeaſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling God to Man; neither of which it done, if only a Promiſe be procured to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150330:84"/>ſave Men upon their fulfilling the conditions of a New Law.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> If Chriſt only purchaſed a Covenant of life, then his Redemption is much more in-effectual to fave, than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall was to deſtroy Man. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18, 20. comparing the Death of Chriſt with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Fall, ſaith, <hi>As Sin reigned to death, ſo Grace much more reigneth to life; as Sin aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to condemnation, Grace much more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to juſtification and life:</hi> but where is this much more? the Obedience of Chriſt falls far ſhort of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience in its effects, if he only purchaſed conditions of life. <hi>Adam</hi> in a few moments by one tranſgreſſion procured a ſentence of certain death upon every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual perſon that ſhould naturally deſcend from him, as ſoon as they ſhould have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but Jeſus Chriſt by his tranſcendent Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of thirty four years, by induring the Wrath of God, the rage of Men and Devils, and a moſt ignominious death, purchaſed life for no one certain Man, but only conditions whereupon they that ſhould hear of them (not half Mankind) ſhould be ſaved, if they did fulfil them; which, for any thing he purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or was contained in the Covenant of life, was a meer contingency, <hi>viz.</hi> whether any ſhould ever believe and be ſaved or not.</p>

The Covenant required no more, then that God ſhould be ready faithfully to give eternal life ro all that fulfilled it; and all that Chriſt purchaſed, was a Promiſe that he would ſo be, which would have been true, though all men had periſhed by their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and ſo Chriſt might have had the empty Title of a Redeemer, without any perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redeemed by him: And this <hi>Arminius,

               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6ly.</hi> If Chriſt intended his death for certain particular perſons, then he purchaſed more than a meer covenant or conditions of Life. The conſequence is evident, If he purchaſed life to be given to certain men certainly &amp; infallibly, then he purchaſed more than offer of life to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conditions, which they might, or might not perform. The Minor, That Chriſt in his death intended the redemption of certain, particular perſons, the Scriptures aſſirm, <hi>He laid down his Life for the Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10.15, 16. even for thoſe of the Gentiles, that were not of the Jewiſh Fold, and ſo yet knew him not; And the effects of this laying down his life for them was on purpoſe to call them in due time, <hi>v.</hi> 16. to teach and make them follow him, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and to keep them ſafe to life eternal by his own and the Fathers power, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. and from theſe Sheep are diſtinguiſhed thoſe who are not of his Sheep, and therefore all means are ineffectual to make them believe, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>He died to gather together in one all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150330:86"/>the Children of God,</hi> Joh. 11.52. <hi>that were ſcattered abroad,</hi> i. e. all the Elect of God, diſperſed throughout all Nations: And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.30. Therefore Chriſt redeemed particular perſons, and did not only purchaſe Grants and Covenants.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>7ly.</hi> Chriſt purchaſed the Spirit and Grace to make his Death effectual to thoſe he died for; therefore he purchaſed more than a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. A meer Covenant of Grace only promiſeth Life upon conditions of Faith and Obedience, leaving it to men whether they will perform them or not; as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works promiſed life to perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then left it to <hi>Adam</hi> whether he would obey or not: A meer Covenant makes no proviſion of grace and ſtrength to enable men to perform it; If then Chriſt purchaſed grace, to believe and to obey for the Elect, he purchaſed more than a Covenant of Grace; and that he did ſo hath been partly proved, and may be further evidenced by this, That when Chriſt ſaith, he <hi>laid down his life for the Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10.16, &amp;c. he preſently adds he muſt <hi>bring home all the Sheep, and make one Fold, under one Shepheard himſelf,</hi> and that he will <hi>make them follow him,</hi> and will <hi>preſerve and lead them to Eternal Life, and no Wolves ſhall pluck them out of his hand,</hi> v. 27, 28, 29. Alſo that he died to gather into one all the Children of God: This muſt be done by his Spirit and Grace purchaſed by his Redemption, and that

               <p>I conclude, the Sum of this Doctrine comes to this, That God took occaſion by the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Obedience and Death of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to grant men terms of Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> if they ſhould believe and obey the Goſpel, not as any ſatisfaction to his Juſtice or Law, which man had broke, but as ſome kind of <hi>ſalvo</hi> to his Honour, at leaſt as he was pleaſed to interpret it: And what need Chriſt have been God to do no more than this?

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Nature of Faith, that it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth as an Inſtrument applying the Promiſes of life in Chriſt, and not as a Condition or Part of Obedience.</head>
               <p>T The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles, Act.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. to this end, that they might receive the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance amongſt thom which are ſanctified by Faith which is in Chriſt; therefore forgiveneſs and a right to the heavenly Inheritance comes by Faith: But what this Faith is and how it gives right to Life, is now to be inquired into. In explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of Faith I ſhall wave all that is uſually drawn from Philoſophy to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the nature and difference of Man's Soul and his Faculties; and the difference of the Faculties from each other, alſo from the nature of Habits intellectual or moral, which things are fit Exerciſes for Scholars, but not fit to build the Doctrine of Juſtification and Eternal life upon; and if the beſt Philoſophers can give us no certain account how men ſee and hear, and how the external Senſes (which yet are more material in their operations than the underſtanding) do exerciſe their functions; there is much leſs certainty to be had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Faculties, Operations and Habits of the rational part; and the Scripture ſpeaks of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150330:88"/>believing as a work of the whole Soul, <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.9. The like may be ſaid of every Grace, and of every Sin, that hath the conſent of the Heart, that they carry the whole Soul with them: What then is this Faith? The <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> affirm Faith and Obedience to be really the ſame thing,<note place="margin">

Opera &amp; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des nullo modo diſtinguuntur à Paulo, nec ab ea ſeperari queant, imò animo ſeu forma fidei ſunt.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> agree with them in this, and <hi>our late Authors</hi> with them both, and make believing and obeying the Goſpel all one; and to be juſtified by Faith with them is to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by obedience to the Goſpel:<note place="margin">Aphor. Th. <hi>70.</hi>
                  </note> Hence it is that <hi>they</hi> deſcribe Faith to be, ſo to believe God, as to love him, fear him, truſt him, and obey him in every particular command, or more briefly, to be an accepting of Chriſt for our Lord and Saviour, <hi>i. e.</hi> to promiſe obedience to him,<note place="margin">Ibid. 69, <hi>&amp;</hi> 67.</note> and to deſire and expect to be ſaved by him. Now we grant, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is ſometime taken for the whole Doctrine or Mind of Chriſt containing both Promiſes, Precepts and Threatnings, though properly it be nothing but a Promiſe of Life through Chriſt, in contradiſtinction to all Law and Precepts; ſo alſo the Faith of Chriſt and of the Goſpel doth ſometimes comprehend the whole Chriſtian Profeſſion, whereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe both a belief of the doctrine and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Command of Chriſt: Yet Faith, taken properly, is to be diſtinguiſhed from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:150330:88"/>all obediential Graces, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are the immediate cauſe of obedience, as much as thoſe graces are diſtinct from each from other; as Love from Fear, both from Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That we may wave that Philoſophical queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo, whether Graces be ſeveral diſtinct ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, or one univerſal habit, diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral acts and objects, it is ſufficient if Faith be diſtinct by its acts and proper object from all other graces, as much as they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed each from other: And that it is ſo, is evident, becauſe it is an aſſent of the mind to divinely revealed truth: Its acts are to believe or aſſent; its formal object is the revealed truth of God, as ſuch (we ſpeak of Divine Faith only.) The immediate End of it is the ſatisfaction of the mind in the certainty of a true propoſition, and the like. All theſe are diſtinct from love, fear, deſire, which are the immediate principles of all obedience or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in doing good, or avoiding evil. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Faith is the root of obedience, not as the immediate principle of the elicite acts of obedience, but as a more remote principle, which doth excite and direct all the immediate principles of it. Thus Faith is prerequired to ſeeking and ſerving of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. to the End; and yet the immediate principles of them were fear, <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſelf-denial, <hi>v.</hi> 25. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage, contempt of the World, and the like. <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the heart,</hi> Acts 15.9. Therefore it is not love it ſelf, or the purity of the heart, but ſomething that inclineth and diſpoſeth to love
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:150330:89"/>and purity; and ſurely before we can love and obey God, there muſt be an apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his goodneſs, faithfulneſs, readineſs to accept and reward, which muſt incline the heart to it: We cannot love and ſerve him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

If afflictions be properly the puniſhment of ſin, then in equity, they that are moſt ſinful, and leaſt ſanctifyed, ſhould have moſt afflictions; but it is often otherwiſe.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150330:103"/>receiveth.

If cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements be ſigns that we are Sons of God, how are they ſigns that we are not perfectly juſtified? If they are certain effects of God's Love, how are they proper puniſhments and fruits of the Curſe? It is rather a fruit of the Curſe to want them when we need them, a ſign we are Baſtards and not Sons; therefore to have them cannot be a part of the Curſe: But to make this more clear, I ſhall add theſe two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The Curſe was the Sentence of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt man,<note place="margin">1ſt.</note> of death at laſt and all miſeries tending to that iſſue, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. If then the afflictions of this life are parts of the Curſe to the godly, then are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their death and ruine, but if they are intended only for their good, then they are natural evils but not curſes, and natural evils may be inflicted without ſin: Even <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius, Epiſcopius</hi> and others of their chief Friends grant, That God may without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice lay temporal evils upon men without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſin, of his own meer pleaſure.</p>
               <p>If Afflictions be part of the Curſe to the godly, it muſt be by ſome Law:<note place="margin">2ly.</note> It cannot be by the Law of Grace; for that is a remedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Law, threatning no curſe to them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it: If by the Law of Works, then Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150330:104"/>are in part ſtill under the Law; whereas the Apoſtle makes theſe inconſiſtent, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law and under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Moreover, Afflictions (if they be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) muſt be ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice. For the Law requires nothing but in order to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice by obedience, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for failure, and then Chriſt hath not redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, part of it remaining for us to bare; and ſo Chriſt's Redemption muſt be diminiſhed, he having onely purchaſed that the Law ſhould not have its full force, <hi>viz.</hi> to condemn us for ever, but that we ſhould have terms of grace or life eternal; nevertheleſs that we ſhould be left in the hands of the Law for this life, that God may lay what curſes upon us he pleaſeth, ſo that he ſave our Souls. The ſame is to be ſaid concerning ſin and ſpiritual evils; ſome ſins are proper chaſtiſements, when men are ſuffered to run into ſome ſins to correct them for former ſins: As <hi>David</hi>'s Murder was a correction for his Adultery; but theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements proceed really from the love of God though mixed with fatherly diſpleaſure: but for the general, that God hath left ſin in the hearts and lives of the Godly is not to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Law or the Curſe, but to magnifie his Grace and Wiſdome in over-ruling ſin and death to his own Glory, and to further man's Salvation by thoſe things which the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to undermine and overthrow both.</p>

               <p>The Scriptures teach that <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and great Exemplar of all Believers was juſtified by Faith, <hi>his Faith was counted to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.3. And that this Faith was a Truſt in the Promiſe of God is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both from the occaſion and immediate Object of it, the Promiſe of a Son againſt all natural hope and probability, and that his Seed ſhould be numerous, be the people of God, the Bleſſed of the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6, 18. &amp;c. and alſo from the Apoſtles Explication, or Amplification of this Faith, in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a believing in hope againſt hope and a not conſidering the natural impoſſibility of the thing promiſed, and not ſtaggering at the Promiſe through unbelief, but being ſtrong in Faith and fully perſwaded that God was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:150330:107"/>able to perform what he promiſed; and that this Faith juſtified him, as ſuch a truſt in the Promiſes, and not as an Act of Obedience, is evident from the Apoſtles own Reaſon in the cloſe of that Diſcourſe, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Becauſe it was a firm truſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God: It is alſo added, <hi>v.</hi> 23. That this Example was written, not for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſake only, but for ours that ſucceed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith alſo ſhall be imputed to us for Righteouſneſs, if we believe in him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt from the dead, <hi>who died for our ſins and roſe again for our juſtification,</hi> v. 24, 25. If this was written for our ſakes, then the Faith that juſtifieth us muſt be a truſt in the Promiſe as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was, even in the Promiſe of Life through the death of Chriſt, and muſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us as a truſt in that Promiſe as his did him, and not upon any other account. It is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for which God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies believing Sinners; but becauſe they are rational Creatures, God doth not juſtifie them without their knowledge, conſent, or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but with and by means of it; and this is Faith, <hi>ſc.</hi> Man's truſting in or acceptance of Life promiſed in Chriſt, which doth render the ſubject, as a rational Creature, capable of pardon and mercy by a Promiſe, though that natural capacity of the ſubject would not obtain pardon, if it were not promiſed to it, and this is all we mean, when we ſay, <hi>Faith is the Instrument of our Juſtification,</hi> viz. That God having promiſed Juſtification through
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150330:107"/>Chriſt to all that believe or truſt in it; this Faith doth truſt in it, or is that diſpoſition of the ſoul, whereby it doth truſt in that promiſe, and ſo obtain a grant of Jnſtification: We acknowledge, to believe God's Promiſes is commanded by him, and an act of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him always indiſpenſibly due; but we ſay, That Faith obtaineth any thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and Juſtification in particular; not as, or becauſe it obeyeth the general command of believing Gods Promiſes; but as it truſteth in, dependeth upon the Promiſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that God fulfilleth the Promiſe of Pardon, Juſtification, and the immediate fruits of it to a Believer, out of his meer goodneſs and faithfulneſs, not out of remunerative Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Debt, as he muſt, if he juſtifieth for Faith, as an act of Obedience to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

As if the Elect Angels that ſtand were not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or accepted in and by their own integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe preſerved by the Grace of God; or as if <hi>Adam</hi> could not have been juſtifyed by keeping the Law, unleſs he had done it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his own connate ſtrength, without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or aſſiſtance of Divine Grace throughout his Life: What the Grace is which theſe men allow to our obedience is yet uncertain; but this altereth not the nature of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if it be by obedience it is not of grace but of works, <hi>i. e.</hi> a man is pronounced Juſt or Righteous for his own obedience by what principle ſoever it be wrought; therefore the ſaith here ſpoken of neither is nor doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude obedience. Again, It is a Faith that the Promiſe may be ſure or firm to all the Seed, but if obedience be the condition of life, the Promiſe cannot be ſure to all or any Believers, <hi>Ergò,</hi> this Faith doth not include Obedience. Profeſſed <hi>Arminians</hi> grant there can be no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ordinarily of any particular man's Salvation, yea that there is no abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150330:113"/>thet any Man ſhould be ſaved, though Chriſt died for them all: Others ſpeak more dubiouſly; but if Juſtification be ſuſpended upon our Obedience to the Goſpel to our lives end; it cannot be certain to any Man, that he ſhall be juſtifyed and ſaved, till he be out of the World: there may be indeed an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective certainty of the Promiſe in general, <hi>viz.</hi> He that obeyeth to the End ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but thus the promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> was as certain, <hi>viz,</hi> if he had obeyed perfectly to the End, he ſhould thereby be juſtifyed; but here was a Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he and his Seed ſhould be bleſſed; and this Promiſe was not made to the Works of the Law, but to the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, that the promiſe might be certain, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they ſhould certainly attain the promiſed bleſſedneſs, and by no means fall ſhort of it; but this certainty comes not from perſevering Obedience, which is it ſelf uncertain, <hi>Ergò.</hi> If any ſay, Believers may be ſure they ſhall perſevere, and ſo the Promiſe ſhall be certain. I anſwer, None of the Authors we deal with, will ſay ſo; and if they ſhould, this would overthrow Obedience, being the condition of our Juſtification; for then we ſhould have an abſolute Promiſe of perſeverance: and ſo of Juſtification, before we are perfectly juſtifyed, which no ſober man will affirm: Beſides, to what is this Promiſe of perſeverance made? to Faith? then Faith alone hath the Promiſe of Obedience and Perſeverance, whereby we muſt be juſtified, though they will not allow
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150330:113"/>it to juſtifie us, and then they contend to little purpoſe. Moreover, this Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſuch, as whereby both <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law, and <hi>Gentiles</hi> exempt from that Law, ſhould be juſtifyed; but the <hi>Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, were not juſtified by Obedience to the Goſpel diſpenſation, which then was not given, nor was <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf juſtified by it, which was not then in force; nor yet are the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſince the abolition of the Law obliged to the ſame Obedience that <hi>Abraham</hi> was, he being under the Law of Circumciſion and Sacrifices, and other Inſtitutions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward incorporated with the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> therefore this Faith which juſtifieth <hi>Abraham</hi> and all Believers alike, is not Obedience to the Goſpel, or any edition of the Law of God, and the Apoſtle himſelf explains it in the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Abraham was made the Father of many Nations before him whom he believed,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

All that can be ſaid is, That ſuch a man is in that way wherein if he continue to the end he ſhall be juſtifyed, but if he continue not to the end, he ſhall no more be juſtifyed than he that never entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that way: Nor can theſe Effects of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſtand upon the foundation of obedience; <hi>1ſt.</hi> Not peace and reconciliation with God; For if we are to be juſtifyed by obeying the Goſpel to our lives end, then God is not at peace with us, nor reconciled to us till then: There is a ſuſpenſion of the execution of the Curſe of the Law, and there is a Law of Life given, by which (when we have fulfilled it) we ſhall be ſaved, and former ſins forgiven, but if we fail (as we may) both the Curſe of the Law and the Condemnation of the Goſpel will fall upon us; all this while we are but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationers for life, and all God's kindneſſes to us ſpiritual and temporal, are merciful encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to us, but not the Effects of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. <hi>2ly.</hi> Not the preſent favour of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150330:118"/>God, God indeed out of his infinite goodneſs beſtoweth many bleſſings for our preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to own and to encourage obedience, but they proceed not from the Love of a Father to Children; the greateſt inward comfort and joys of the Godly, cannot be tokens of father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love or certain ſpecial favour: For Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth certainly preſuppoſe Juſtification.

We read of the fall of ſome, as <hi>Noah, Lot, Sampſon,</hi> and read nothing of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and yet no queſtion made of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: We read alſo of <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Repentance, and their great Sorrow, yet not that they reckoned themſelves under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: We find <hi>David</hi> and others, in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> much complaining of their Sins and Afflictions, the fruit of them, of the want of God's Favour and Preſence; yet they call him their God, and beg the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of his Favour, that he would not take his Spirit utterly from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11, 12. All their Complaints and Prayers argue want of preſent fenſe of God's Favour, and the quicknings of his Spirit: not that they were utterly out of favour, or a reconciled ſtate. It is true, it is not ſafe for young or unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Chriſtians, when guilty of foul ſins, or great decays of Zeal, to retain mueh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their good ſtate: but rather, to remember from whence they are fallen, and to repent and do their firſt works, becauſe they may be eaſily miſtaken about the truth of grace, when there hath been but little proof of it: but well-rooted and experienced Chriſtians upon their miſcarriages are not bound to queſtion their Juſtification, but to humble themſelves greatly for abuſing the grace and kindneſs of God, and ſubmit to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150330:121"/>his fatherly correction, and ſhould they doubt as ſome do, yet is not that the beſt and moſt proper motive to humble and recover them, but rather a diſcouragement and hinderance. Fear of Hell, and ſuch like Motives work beſt upon the unexperienced and ignorant; but the want of God's Preſence, and other effects of his Fatherly diſpleaſure are more ſuitable, and more effectual to grown Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians: Nor doth the Scripture ſpeak any thing of the condemnation of thoſe that die in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſin; and either have not actual repentance, or not time to make proof of the ſincerity of it. The young Prophet, 1 <hi>King</hi> 14, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.21, 22. were both ſlain preſently upon an act of diſobedience to the expreſs Commands of God; and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſaid to render their Salvation doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: and in this caſe I would ask whether the habit of Faith and Obedience be utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed? If not, it is ſtrange that Men ſhould go to Hell with a real diſpoſition to love and ſerve God, only wanting time to recover themſelves from ſome fall.

               <p>The Scripture for the moſt part ſpeaketh to the Conſcience and Affections,<note place="margin">2dly.</note> more than the Judgement, and therefore handleth not things diſtinctly and didactically, but putteth many things together, ſaith and obedience in general or in particular duties, as is moſt ſuited to practice; and therefore it is no good Argument, Faith and Obedience are joyned together often times as the means of Salvation without diſtinguiſhing the ſeveral Offices of each, and what influence each have upon the ſeveral parts of our Salvation, <hi>ergò,</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and alike do juſtify us before God. Yet it is evident from the whole Tenour of the Scripture, That forgiveneſs of ſin, reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peace; with God, hope of Heaven, all come by our flying to and hope in Mercy and Grace alone. This was renew'd to <hi>Adam</hi> by promiſe of the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17.

If obedience to the Goſpel as the Law of Chriſt, be that alone to which Juſtification is promiſed, then unbelief of his Merit, when a man is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of it, can no more damn him than the unbelief of any other Hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, ſuppoſe his being born at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or living at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> &amp;c. when a man is not ſufficiently perſwaded of them: For theſe were neceſſary <hi>ex Hypotheſi,</hi> becauſe God would have it ſo; and Chriſt's Merit was no more by their confeſſion, nor was it impoſſible (according to their Principles) but Chriſt might have been a King and enacted this Law of Grace, though he had not been a Prieſt and ſatisfied for Sin: And thus we have the bottom of this Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>Next it is proved that Chriſt juſtifyeth as a Prophet;<note place="margin">p. 25.</note> becauſe the Goſpel is a Law that muſt be promulgated and expounded, and a Doctrine that muſt be taught and preſſed on Sinners, till they receive it, and believe that they may be juſtified; and this Chriſt doth as a Teacher, and Faith muſt accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him.</p>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:150330:140"/>Chriſt as King, Prieſt, and Prophet, (as it is here taken for ſubjection to the whole Law of Chriſt or obedience to him) is not the onely damning ſin; final deſpair of the Mercy of God in Chriſt will as certainly damn as final diſobedience to Chriſt and contempt of him, yea though there be a willingneſs to obey, if they could have any hope of Mercy; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is not the oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap> of obedience or of faith in Chriſt as King, Prieſt, and Prophet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is not the only unbelief that damns.</p>
                  <p>Again, If diſobedience to Chriſt be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damning ſin, then obedience is the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condition, then a <hi>Socinian</hi> that obeys the Goſpel Precepts, and acknowledgeth Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, King, and Prophet of his Church, may and muſt be ſaved though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Prieſthood and truſt not at all in his Bloud: For obedience reſpects not Chriſt's Prieſthood at all, though that be here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a ſhew; Chriſt as a Prieſt reconciles us to God, and intercedes for us; the onely Grace that reſpects this is Faith, or a truſt in it for reconciliation and acceptance. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obedience be the only ſaving condition, then that will ſave without a truſt in the Bloud of Chriſt: If it be ſaid they make Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience both to be the entire condition,</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Their Faith is nothing but Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (as hath been abundantly proved) and is largely inſiſted on under this Argument; particularly from, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. where he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not is expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is ſometimes rendred Diſobedient; hence it is
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:150330:141"/>in ferred, That the only unbelief is diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the only Faith is Obedience to the Goſpel: Nor is it poſſible to joyn Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the juſtifying a Sinner in the uſual acception of Faith; for to truſt in meer Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for reconciliation and life, and to obey pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that we may have life, are things <hi>toto ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi> oppoſite, utterly inconſiſtent: nor can there be a truſt in the Promiſe of Life in their Opinion, till a man hath obeyed in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; becauſe the Promiſe is made to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: So truſt in the Promiſe muſt follow the condition, not be a part of it: And thus much for theſe Arguments, to all which I oppoſe this one:</p>
                  <p>Juſtification is the acquitting of a ſinner from ſin and guilt, and the entitling him to life eternal; But this is purchaſed fully and onely by the Obedience and Bloud of Chriſt, the ſhedding and offering whereof is his Prieſtly Office only; therefore Chriſt juſtifyeth onely as a Prieſt: And Faith apprehending Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt reſpect only the Prieſthood of Chriſt. I prove the <hi>Minor;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. He loved and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from our ſins in his own Bloud, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. When he had by himſelf purged our ſins (<hi>i. e.</hi> by the offering of himſelf) he ſet down at the Right Hand of the Majeſty in the Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. And the Apoſtle proves largely, That Chriſt as a Highprieſt offering his own Bloud in the Tabernacle of his own Body, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal redemption for us, that by this
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:150330:141"/>one offering he hath brought in remiſſion of ſins, and for ever perfected them that are ſanctified, ſprinkled with his Bloud, as all things under the Law were cleanſed by the ſprinkling of bloud, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11. to <hi>ch.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 18. And in this Chriſt was a more excellent Sacrifice than thoſe under the Law; that they did but typifye pardon and cleanſing, but his Sacrifice doth really cleanſe the Conſcience; they cleanſed from ceremonial pollutions, as touching dead bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and reſtored men to the Congregation, but his Bloud cleanſeth from dead works, our own ſins, and maketh us really accepted that we may ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 19.13, 14. Now the Levitical Prieſts were Teachers and Rulers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome were Prophets, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> ſome were Kings alſo, as the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> but they took away the ſins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reconciled them to God, only as Prieſts, by offering up Sacrifices for them; ſo alſo Chriſt though he be a Prophet and King, yet he maketh reconciliation for Sinners only as a Prieſt, by offering himſelf in ſacrifice to God for them. Now the reaſon of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, Faith, that it obtain Juſtification, muſt look to Chriſt under that notion, or in that way only by which he hath purchaſed Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, therefore it muſt look to him only as a Prieſt, or which is all one, truſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Reconciliation through the ſatisfaction and death of Chriſt; and thus the Apoſtle concludes from the ſame Premiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Having therefore boldneſs to enter
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:150330:142"/>into the Holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us, through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh; and having a High-prieſt over the Houſe of God: let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> It is Faith in this High-Prieſt, by which we draw nigh to God with boldneſs, confidence of acceptance, and then that makes us devote our ſelves ſincerely to his Service.</p>
